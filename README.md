This is Keyronex Lite, a branch of the Keyronex OS. Keyronex is a purely
hobbyist operating system currently targeting the QEMU m68k 'virt' emulated
machine and 64-bit PCs. In the future Amiga systems with 68040s will also be a
taget, and possibly also AArch64 or RISC-V, both initially only with QEMU's
'virt' emulated machines.

There is little of interest to see in this repository.
